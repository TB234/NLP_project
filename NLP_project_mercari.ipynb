For example the stopword does not contain 've', so after tokenizing a word like 'would've', the 've' would be ratained in the transformed text. Also stopsword that are transformed as a result of transformation like stemming or lemmaization might not be caught because the preprocessor step using sklearn's CountVectorizer or TfidfVectorizer is done before tokenization, but the stopwords are only removed after tokenization. Hence we create our custom preprocessor function than can will first remove stop words and then stem or lemmatize what is left of the text \n",
